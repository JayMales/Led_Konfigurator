### Notes:
This program requires sudo because it is editing system files.
Unless you are superuser, this script will not be able to edit the leds

### Usage:
```
chmod +x Led_Konfigurator
sudo ./Led_Konfigurator
```

### Comments:
I didn't use returns because they can only be ints in bash. I found that it is easier to just have a global variable that you set to what you would normally return.
